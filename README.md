## 🚀 About Me

#### Hi there, i'm Kai also called Bakers! I’m a cross-platform app developer creating intuitive SwiftUI and Android apps with the goal of improving daily life through clean design and smart functionality.
Many of my public repositories are not fully complete, as most of them were created for learning and experimental purposes.
Further developed or actively maintained projects can be found in my pinned repositories.
